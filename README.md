# Twitter Bot Detection App

## Project Overview
The **Twitter Bot Detection App** is a machine learning-powered application designed to analyze Twitter accounts and determine the likelihood of them being bots. The app fetches user and tweet data, extracts various features, and classifies the account as either a **bot** or **not a bot**.

### Problem Statement
Social media platforms, including Twitter, are often flooded with automated bot accounts that spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, or engage in spam activities. This project aims to provide a reliable tool to detect such bot accounts and enhance the credibility of online interactions.

### Key Features
- Fetches real-time Twitter user data using the **Tweepy API**.
- Analyzes key metrics such as followers, tweets, likes, and engagement.
- Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze text features.
- Implements a **Random Forest** machine learning model for classification.
- Generates detailed reports and allows users to download results as a **PDF**.
- Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**.
- Provides a demo video for better understanding.

## Model & Prediction
The model is a **Random Forest classifier** trained on a dataset containing bot and human Twitter accounts. It considers:
- User account metrics (followers, tweets, likes, retweets, etc.).
- NLP-based text features (word length, entity recognition, etc.).
- Engagement metrics (replies, retweets, credibility score, etc.).

After processing, the app predicts if the account is a **bot** or **not a bot**.

## Report Generation
The app generates a **detailed report** with:
- User engagement statistics.
- NLP-based text feature analysis.
- Bot detection prediction.
- **Downloadable PDF report** for further analysis.
